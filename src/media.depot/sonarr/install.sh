# Provision

# Provision the environment.

# Construct user / group for this
# Construct directories related to this project
# Set ownership of directories to user:group (just incase)

# Set up any specific content related to this project
# For example:
# deluge `auth` file needs to have a daemon user setup, we can do this here
# we will create something like 'couchpotato-user:<random>'.  This should automatically
# be added to couchpotato to configure the environment.

# Suggestions needed.
